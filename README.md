# project1 tic tac toe
  A simple game of tic tac toe using javascript, some jquery, html and some css for styling. Also utilized bit balloon to host the web page online.
  I created a wire frame so that I could have a layout of how I wanted to game board and page to look before starting to write code. I then created a user story to understand how the user would interact with the page/game. I realized that there is more to the game of tic tac toe than first meets the eye and its bit harder to layout it out in code.
  No installations needed for the user just click the link to the page and play some tic tac toe             designer-utilization-21025.bitballoon.com.
  Some unsolved issues are that you can override the tile that is already on the board and if a player accidentally clicks on the wrong tile it will alert to a cats draw after nine moves.
