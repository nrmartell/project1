# project1 tic tac toe
Hey there it's time for a good ol' fashion game of tic tac toe.
If you've been living under a rock here are some instructions.
The game consists of a blank table and you'll need two players.
You'll need to fill it with x's and o's.
First one to a row of three with their markers wins.
Just click the board and we'll do the rest.
