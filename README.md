# project1 tic tac toe
  A simple game of tic tac toe mainly using javascript and some jquery to produce moves and manipulate the DOM. HTML and some CSS are used for basic styling and to give the correct layout of page. I also utilized bit balloon to host the web page online and git and github to commit and keep track of changes and have a place to revert back to if errors occur during editing process.
  
  I created a wire frame so that I could have an idea of how I wanted the game board and page to look before starting to write code. I then created a user story to understand how the user would interact with the page/game. I realized that there is more to the game of tic tac toe than first meets the eye and its bit harder to layout it out in code.
  
  No installations needed for the user just click the link to the page and play some tic tac toe             designer-utilization-21025.bitballoon.com.
  
  Some unsolved issues are that you can override the tile that is already on the board and if a player accidentally clicks on the wrong tile it will alert to a cats draw after nine moves. I also had issues with one of my buttons not showing up correctly on the page after working to make it more responsive. I uploaded site on bitballoon before issue presented itselt.
